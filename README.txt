===== Share Ride ======
Dung Le, Hamza Alsarhan
ShareRide is an iOS application designed to help college students find and provide transportation for one another. The app allows users who has a car to post about their trip and how many free seats they have in their car. On the other hand, users looking for rides will be able to access the list of rides, with the ability to filter trips based on origin or destination. The riders are then able to request a ride by preliminarily booking it, and then await the driverâ€™s acceptance. Once a match occurs, the driver and the rider can message each other through the app regarding further details about the trip, as well as possible compensations.
Our app targets students of colleges in rural areas, where transportation could be scarce. It will tackle the problem of the lack of affordable, convenient transportation. It will also encourage more interactions among members of the same community.
IMPORTANT: When you are opening the project with XCode, please open ShareRide.xcworkspace instead of ShareRide.xcodeproj.
In ShareRide, we used Firebase as our backend. In order for the app to use Firbase as backend, there is a file named GoogleService-Info.plist that needed to be in the current directory in order for XCode to compile. This file should be in the correct directory when you unzip the downloaded zip file. In case you see the there is a file with this name, yet colored in red, (this means the .plist file missing), please drag the GoogleService-Info.plist that we sent along this zip file into the current directory. This should not happen but there is a chance that the Main.storyboard is also missing (it once did when we try to zip the file and unzip it using different machine). In this case, please also download the Main.storyboard file sent along with the zip file.
Besides, there are some warnings about the missing files including the mainTabBarViewController.swift. We have tested it by zipping the files and open in a different machine, and it still worked perfectly. So this should not be a problem.
At this point, we expect no crash or bugs in our code. The notification tab may need some more work, which will be discussed in details in the evaluation, but in general, no bugs or problem issues a user might encounter.
