### Project Description
ShareRide is an iOS application designed to help college students find and provide transportation for one another. The app allows users who has a car to post about their trip and how many free seats they have in their car. On the other hand, users looking for rides will be able to access the list of rides, with the ability to filter trips based on origin or destination. The riders are then able to request a ride by preliminarily booking it, and then await the driverâ€™s acceptance. Once a match occurs, the driver and the rider can message each other through the app regarding further details about the trip, as well as possible compensations.

Our app targets students of colleges in rural areas, where transportation could be scarce. It will tackle the problem of the lack of affordable, convenient transportation. It will also encourage more interactions among members of the same community.

### Important Notes
Due to some technical difficulties with GitHub in the beginning, the directories of the Main.storyboard and GoogleService-Info.plist were set inside the Downloads folder. Therefore, in order for the project to build properly, please put these two files into the Downloads folder on your machine whether you decide to clone or download this project.
